Arduino does not support "REAL" parallel tasks (aka Threads), but we can make use of this Library to
improve our code, and easily schedule tasks with fixed (or variable) time between runs.

This Library helps to maintain organized and to facilitate the use of multiple tasks. We can
use Timers Interrupts, and make it really powerfull, running "pseudo-background" tasks under the rug.

For example, I personaly use it for all my projects, and put all sensor aquisition and
filtering inside it, leaving the main loop, just for logic and "cool" part.

#### ArduinoThreads is a library for managing the periodic execution of multiple tasks.

Blinking an LED is often the very first thing an Arduino user learns. And this demonstrates that periodically performing one single task, like toggling the LED state, is really easy. However, one may quickly discover that managing multiple periodic tasks is not so simple if the tasks have different execution periods.

ArduinoThreads is designed to simplify programs that need to perform multiple periodic tasks. The user defines a Thread object for each of those tasks, then lets the library manage their scheduled execution.

It should be noted that these are not “threads” in the real computer-science meaning of the term: tasks are implemented as functions that are periodically run to completion. On the one hand, this means that the only way a task can “yield” the CPU is by returning to the caller, and it is thus inadvisable to delay() or do long waits inside a task. On the other hand, this makes ArduinoThreads memory friendly, as no stack needs to be allocated per task.

## Installation

1. "Download":https://github.com/ivanseidel/ArduinoThread/archive/master.zip the Master branch from gitHub.
2. Unzip and modify the Folder name to "ArduinoThread" (Remove the '-master')
3. Paste the modified folder on your Library folder (On your `Libraries` folder inside Sketchbooks or Arduino software).
4. Restart Arduino IDE

**If you are here, because another Library requires this class, just don't waste time reading bellow. Install and ready.**


## Getting Started

There are many examples showing many ways to use it. Here, we will explain Class itself,
what it does and "how" it does.

There are basicaly, three Classes included in this Library:
`Thread`, `ThreadController` and `StaticThreadController` (both controllers inherit from Thread).

- `Thread class`: This is the basic class, witch contains methods to set and run callbacks,
  check if the Thread should be runned, and also creates a unique ThreadID on the instantiation.

- `ThreadController class`: Responsable for "holding" multiple Threads. Can also be called
  as "a group of Threads", and is used to perform run in every Thread ONLY when needed.

- `StaticThreadController class`: Slighly faster and smaller version of `ThreadController`.
  It works similar to `ThreadController`, but once constructed it can't add or remove threads to run.

* The instantiation of a Thread class is very simple:

```c++
Thread myThread = Thread();
// or, if initializing a pointer
Thread* myThread = new Thread();
```


* Setting up a thread is essential. You can configure many things:

```c++
myThread.enabled = true; // Default enabled value is true
myThread.setInterval(10); // Setts the wanted interval to be 10ms
/*
	This is useful for debugging
	(Thread Name is disabled by default, to use less memory)
	(Enable it by definint USE_THREAD_NAMES on 'Thread.h')
*/
myThread.ThreadName = "myThread tag";
// This will set the callback of the Thread: "What should I run"?
myThread.onRun(callback_function); // callback_function is the name of the function
```

Ok, creating Threads are not so hard. But what do we do with them now?

* First, let's see how Threads should work, to understand what a `ThreadController` is and does

```c++
// First check if our Thread "should" be runned
if(myThread.shouldRun()){
  // Yes, the Thread should be runned, let's run it
  myThread.run();
}
```

Now that you got the idea, let's think a little bit: What if i have 3, 5, 100 Threads. Do I need to check EACH one?!?

* The answer is: NO. Create a `ThreadController` or `StaticThreadController`,
and put all your boring-complex Threads inside it!

```c++
// Instantiate a new ThreadController
ThreadController controller = ThreadController();
// Now, put a bunch of Threads inside it, FEED it!
controller.add(&myThread); // Notice the & before the thread, IF it's not instantied as a pointer.
controller.add(&hisThread);
controller.add(&sensorReadings);
...
```
or
```c++
// Instantiate a new StaticThreadController with the number of threads to be supplied as template parameter
StaticThreadController<3> controller (&myThread, &hisThread, &sensorReadings);
// You don't need to do anything else, controller now contains all the threads.
...
```

* You have created, configured, grouped it. What is missing? Yes, whe should RUN it!

```c++
// call run on a Thread, a ThreadController or a StaticThreadController to run it
controller.run();
```

This will run all the Threads that NEED to be runned.

Congratulations, you have learned the basics of `ArduinoThread`. If you want some TIPS, see bellow.


### TIPs and Warnings

* ThreadController is not a `LinkedList`. It's "MAXIMUM" size (the maximum Threads that it can
  store) is defined on ThreadController.h (default is 15)

* !!!! VERY IMPORTANT !!!! When extending `Thread` class and implementing the function
  `run()`, always remember to put `runned();` after all, otherwhise the `Thread` will ALWAYS run.

* It's a good idea, to create a Timer interrupt and call a ThreadController.run() there.
That way, you don't need to worry about reading sensors and doing time-sensitive stuff
on your main code (loop). Check `ControllerWithTimer` example.

* Inheriting from `Thread` or even `ThreadController` is always a good idea.
For example, I always create base classes of sensors that extends `Thread`,
so that I can "register" the sensors inside a ThreadController, and forget
about really reading sensors, just getting theirs values within my main code.
Checkout `SensorThread` example.

* Remember that `ThreadController` is in fact, a Thread. If you want to enable
or disable a GROUP of Threads, think about putting all of them inside a ThreadController,
and adding this ThreadController to another ThreadController (YES! One ThreadController 
inside another). Check `ControllerInController` example.

* There is a `StaticThreadController` which is better to use when you know exact number of
threads to run. You cannot add or remove threads in runtime, but `StaticThreadController`
doesn't have additional memory overhead to keep all the treads together, doesn't have any
limitations how many threads to store (except of available memory) and also the code may be slighly
more optimized because all the threads always exist and no need to do any runtime checks.

* Check the full example `CustomTimedThread` for a cool application of Threads that runs
for a period, after a button is pressed.

* Running tasks on the Timer interrupts must be tought REALLY carefully
  
  You cannot use "sleep()" inside a interrupt, because it will get into a infinite loop.
  
  Things must do stuff quickly. Waiting too loooong on a interrupt, means waiting too
  loooong on the main code (loop)

  Things might get "scrambled". Since Timers interrupts actualy "BREAK" your code in half
  and start running the interrupt, you might want to call `noInterrupts` and `interrupts`
  on places where cannot be interrupted:

```c++
noInterrupts();
// Put the code that CANNOT be interrupted...
interrupts(); // This will enable the interrupts egain. DO NOT FORGET!
```


## Library Reference

### You should know:

- `bool Thread::enabled` - Enables or disables the Thread. (do not stop it from running, but will
  return false when shouldRun() is called)
- `void Thread::setInterval()` - Setts the desired interval for the Thread (in Ms).
- `bool Thread::shouldRun()` - Returns true, if the Thread should be runned.
  (Basicaly,the logic is: (reached time AND is enabled?).
- `void Thread::onRun(<function>)` - The target callback function to be called.
- `void Thread::run()` - This will run the Thread (call the callback function).
- `int Thread::ThreadID` - Theoretically, it's the address of memory. It's unique, and can
  be used to compare if two threads are identical.
- `int Thread::ThreadName` - A human-redable thread name. Default is "Thread ThreadID"
  eg.: "Thread 141515"; Note that to enable this attribute, you must uncomment the line that disables it on 'Thread.h';
- protected: `void Thread::runned()` - Used to reset internal timer of the Thread.
  This is automaticaly called AFTER a call to `run()`.


- `void ThreadController::run()` - This will run the all `Threads` within the `ThreadController`,
  only if needed (if shouldRun returns true);
- `bool ThreadController::add(Thread* _thread)` - This will add a the thread to the ThreadController,
  and return `true` if suceeded (it the array is full, returns false).
- `void ThreadController::remove(Thread* _thread)` - This will remove the Thread from the ThreadController.
- `void ThreadController::remove(int index)` - This will remove the thread on the position `index`.
- `void ThreadController::clear()` - This will remove ALL threads from the ThreadController array.
- `int ThreadController::size(bool cached = true)` - Returns how many Threads are allocated
  inside the ThreadController. If cached is `false`, will force the calculation of threads.
- `Thread* ThreadController::get(int index)` - Returns the Thread on the position `index`.


- `void StaticThreadController::run()` - This will run the all `Threads` within the `StaicThreadController`,
  only if needed (if shouldRun returns true);
- `int StaticThreadController::size()` - Returns how many Threads are allocated inside the StaticThreadController.
- `Thread* ThreadController::get(int index)` - Returns the Thread on the position `index` and `nullptr` if `index`
  is out of bounds.

### You don't need to know:
- Nothing, yet ;)
